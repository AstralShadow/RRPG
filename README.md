# No longer a billiard-like game
These guys pulled quite the interesting theme.
You control the environment, not the character.

And in billiard, the environment... kinda follows
physics strictly, so if i were to change that it won't
be billiard anymore.

Making this for the SDL Enthusiasts 1K members Game Jam.

_All details about my idea will stay hidden until i implement them. And if all goes smooth, i may actually be able to compile that for Windows 7_
