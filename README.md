# An RPG game engine.
Includes a game as well.

Making this for the SDL Enthusiasts 1K members Game Jam.


## Edit 2022-02-05:
So far, this is a cool limited control rpg engine.
It loads all data from config files.
Currently i'm working on a map editor.
You should be able to run it by pressing M while at
the loading screen.

_All details about my idea will stay hidden until i implement them. And if all goes smooth, i may actually be able to compile that for Windows 7_

## Edit 2022-02-11
It actually compiled for Windows 7 (because i compiled on Windows 7).
