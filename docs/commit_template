#
# reference - connected issue / bug report / pull request
# prefix - the type of commit
# Example prefixes:

# | markdown depend beautify resource config legal
# and anything that can describe the commit in 1 word


# Useful stuff you may want to add to the commit body:

# [Gaol] - what did you try to achieve
# [Solution] - how did you achieve it.
# [Details] - why did you achieve it that way
