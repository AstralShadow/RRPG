        Calm down dear. You must be very tired.
        :sleep 3000
        Don't worry, i haven't sold your brother.
        :sleep 3000
        One friend of yours gave us a sack of gold.
        :sleep 2500

        > Jack
        And you didn't find that suspicious?
        :sleep 3000
        You know i don't have any friends that rich.
        :sleep 3000

        > Klara
        He said you may not remember him,
        :sleep 2000
        because you haven't met for a long time.
        :sleep 2000

        > Jack
        How did he look like?
        :sleep 1500

        > Klara
        He seemed quite old.
        :sleep 1600
        He had a strange walking stick.
        :sleep 2000
        He was wearing dark clothers.
        :sleep 1800
        And he sounded quite tired,
        :sleep 1300
        but he also didn't want to stay for dinner.
        :sleep 2500

        > Jack
        I can't think of anyone like that.
        :sleep 2000

        > Klara
        I think he mentioned he left the
        :sleep 1300
        village before a few decades.
        :sleep 3000

        > Jack
        Maybe i should go ask granny about it.
        :sleep 2000

        > Klara
        Not a bad idea.
        :sleep 1500
        But be fast, the food'll get cold.
        :sleep 1500

        Huh, but you said he's useless.
        :sleep 1000
        
        > Jack

        :sleep 1500
        
        > Klara
        Don't worry, i'm just teasing you.
        :sleep 2000
        
        > Jack
        But Ron is fine, right?
        :sleep 2000

        > Klara
        Yea, he's at chef's place.
        :sleep 2000
        She's trying to cook a new dish.
        :sleep 2000

        > Jack
        She's gonna cook him!!!
        :sleep 1300
        I got to save him!
        :sleep 800
        :move 3 5
        :sleep 300

        > Klara
        Jack, wait!

        > Jack
        :wait
        :remove
        :sleep 1500

        > Klara
        But he knows how much Ron likes food.
        :sleep 1500
        :look up
        :sleep 500
        Why did he panic so fast?
        :sleep 2500
