    Welcome home!
    :sleep 2000

    > Jack
    I sold the horse.
    :sleep 100

    > Klara
    Food is ready.
    :sleep 1700

    > Jack
    Wait, what?
    :sleep 1300
    Where did you get money for that??
    :sleep 1300
    Don't tell me you sold Ron!
    :sleep 1300

        Calm down dear. You must be very tired.
        :sleep 3000
        Don't worry, i haven't sold your brother.
        :sleep 3000
        One friend of yours gave us a sack of gold.
        :sleep 2500

        > Jack
        And you didn't find that suspicious?
        :sleep 3000
        You know i don't have any friends that rich.
        :sleep 3000

        > Klara
        He said you may not remember him,
        :sleep 2000
        because you haven't met for a long time.
        :sleep 2000

        > Jack
        How did he look like?
        :sleep 1500

        > Klara
        :choice > He wore dark clothes.
            :set stranger_looks_dark

            He wore some strange dark clothes.
            :sleep 2000
            I couldn't see his face pretty well.
            :sleep 1800

            > Jack
            Sounds like no good stuff.
            :sleep 1500
            No one normal walks dressed like that.
            :sleep 2000
            And definitely no one gives away gold.
            :sleep 2000
            Or at least not without a good reason.
            :sleep 2000
            
            > Klara
            What did you expect me to do?
            :sleep 1600
            We were so poor that we could starve together!
            :sleep 1800
            I had to accept the money so we can survive.
            :sleep 2500

            > Jack
            Sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel bad.
            :sleep 1800
            I'm simply worried about you.
            :sleep 2000
            Please, don't open to strangers.
            :sleep 1800
            
            > Klara
            I won't, don't worry darling.
            :sleep 1800
            You should be tired, let's eat.
            :sleep 1800

            > Jack
            Sure, i'll go find Ron.
            :sleep 1800
            You should start before us.
            :sleep 1600

            > Klara
            Be fast, the food'll get cold.
            :sleep 1300

            > Jack
            Of course, darling.

            He seemed quite old
            :sleep 1600
            and he had a strange walking stick.
            :sleep 1800

            He was moving slowly and looked very tired.
            :sleep 2500
            I invited him to stay for diner,
            :sleep 1600
            but he refused. Seems like he was busy.
            :sleep 2000
        :end

        > Jack
        I can't think of anyone like that.
        :sleep 2000

        > Klara
        I think he mentioned he left the
        :sleep 1300
        village before a few decades.
        :sleep 3000

        > Jack
        Maybe i should go ask granny about it.
        :sleep 2000

        > Klara
        Not a bad idea.
        :sleep 1500
        But be fast, the food'll get cold.

        Don't worry, i'm just teasing you.
        :sleep 2000

        But Ron is fine, right?
        :sleep 2000

        > Klara
        Yea, he's at chef's place.
        :sleep 2000
        She's trying to cook a new dish.
        :sleep 2000

        > Jack
        She's gonna cook him!!!
        :sleep 1300
        I got to save him!

        But he knows how much Ron likes food.
        :sleep 1500

        Why did he panic so fast?
